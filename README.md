# Password Generator

## My Task

Create an application to generate a random password based on criteria selected by the user. The user can choose whether lowercase, uppercase, numbers or special characters appear in the password. The password generator is an in-browser application that features dynamic HTML and CSS, powered entirely by Javascript.
